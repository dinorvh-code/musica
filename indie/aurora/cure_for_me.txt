I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
I know I created myself
I know I can't fight
The sad days and bad nights
But I never asked for your help

You got hurt, no, we don't belong
Together, so you took the love
From my arms into the
Arms of yours

But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me

I don't like the tension
The misapprehensions
About our nature in love

The glorious teachers
Are no use for creatures
Who knows how to play with the gods

You've got the nerves
But they never show
Unless they hurt
So you blamed it all on my love
The moving heart I've got

But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it, I don't need it

Please, no cure for me
Please, no cure for me
Cure for me, cure for me
Please, no cure for me, cure for me
Cure for me, please, no cure for me
Cure for me, cure for me

(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it

(And you should know)
I don't need a cure for me

(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it

(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me

(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it

(And you should know)
I don't need a cure for me
